This error occurs when using the Expo CLI to build an Android project. The error message is not always clear, but it usually involves an issue with the Android build process. It can manifest in different ways, such as an error during the `expo prebuild` step or a build failure in Android Studio. The root cause is often related to incorrect configurations, missing dependencies, or conflicts between different versions of libraries used in the project.
